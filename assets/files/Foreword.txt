Foreword
Efforts to create African tunes that are closer to the lives of people of
Zimbabwe began way back in 1962, thanks to the generous guidance and
encouragement of the Bethlehem Missionaries such as Fr Lenherr, Schuler and
Feurer of the then Gweru Diocese as well as the blessing from the Bishops�
Conference of the time. This led to a new development of the book, Mupiro
Wedu, later changed to Minamato, which was published by Mambo Press.
Since then, over 1 200 hymns have been composed by men and women of
this country. Mr Stephen Magwa Ponde was identified as the first and main
person to spearhead this big shift in the Church. In some way, he is regarded
as the Father of Shona Catholic hymns in Zimbabwe. He was later joined by
others like A. Shamu Maurunge, W. Makumbe, A. Nyika, D.T. Zavazava,
E. Dhliwayo Chimuti, L. Hakireni, S. Mashoko and A. Makamure from
the Gweru Diocese and Fr E. Ribeiro and C. Chawasarira from the Harare
Diocese. To this date, the group of composers in Zimbabwe now has over 300
members.
Years later, in his report, Fr Lenherr had this to say, �Looking back on how
God made our efforts to succeed, despite their shortcomings, I am grateful for
the rich blessings He has given to the Church among the Shona people. The
courage and dedication of the first composers enabled people to praise God
by means of the musical gifts He has given to them. The fact that so many texts
sung in our Church are taken from the Word of God in the Bible, has had the
amazing side effect that now they know a great part of the Bible by heart.�
Almost all the hymns composed since 1961 are in this book. It is my hope
that this Hymn Book will strengthen and deepen the faith and trust of the
people in God, helping them to cling to God alone in good and bad times so
that they can live by the Gospel values of love, justice, peace and uprightness
in their daily life. It is also my hope that this Hymn Book becomes a simple
but effective tool of evangelisation. I encourage you to use it to the fullest
advantage and also to familiarise yourselves with the old hymns for the greater
glory of God.
